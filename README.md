# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

## Reflections

This is a bit of reflecting on what my process was in debugging the already set up codebase as well as what I learned in the process.

### Process

- I started with the smallest object. The class object, vehicle. From there I went to Facility, DMV and there was no need to investigate DMV data base.

- I started with the smallest, or the most inner scope, because I figure the fixes always have to come from inside and then radiate out. (Like life!)

- I ran the tests as is. And worked my way, one at a time thru the errors. As I fixed one, I would run tests again and repeat until all tests in all spec files without failures.

### Pros/Cons

- #### Pros
  1. The tests we were told had no errors, so we only needed to look at the code to find the errors.

  2. It felt fresh because I didn't write it, so my brain and eyes weren't already jaded.

- #### Cons
  1. It took longer to read thru and comprehend, checking between tests expectations and what was actully being written.

  2. When you wrtie your own code based on tests that YOU also wrote it feels like the territory is a little easier to navigate. But like I mentioned in the *pros* section it is nice to also come in with fresh eyes.
