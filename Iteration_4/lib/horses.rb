# The idea was to find an API of trails systems in the US
# Then make a class and spec with that data.
# From there I would make a horse class where I could create different instances of
## horses with attributes
# I would have made an athleticism class where that would interact with the trails
##  and horses tracking their mileage, difficulty level, etc.

# I did not find an API that would work for me, it was proving much harder than I 
## thought to even get started.

# C'est la vie! It was fun to think about how it would be built and how the classes 
## would interact
